 🎉 Mood Tracker Calendar

    📌 About the Project
        The Mood Tracker Calendar is a web application that allows users to record their mood daily and 
        visually track their emotional patterns throughout the month. Using an interactive calendar and 
        animated flip cards, users can easily log their mood, helping them reflect on their emotional 
        journey.
